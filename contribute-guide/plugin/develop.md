# 3.2 Develop WasmEdge Plug-in

This chapter is WORK IN PROGRESS.

WasmEdge provides a C++ based API for registering extension modules and host functions. While the WasmEdge language SDKs allow registering host functions from a host (wrapping) application, the plugin API allows such extensions to be incorporated into WasmEdge's own building and releasing process.

The C API for the plug-in mechanism is under development. In the future, we will release the C API of plug-in mechanism and recommend developers to implement the plug-ins with C API.
